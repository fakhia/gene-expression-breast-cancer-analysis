## 📖 Project Overview

This repository contains the solution for the **HackBio Internship Surprise Task**, focusing on **gene expression** and **breast cancer diagnostic data** analysis using Python.

The project integrates two biological datasets to perform both **gene-level** and **phenotypic-level** analysis:

- **Part A:** Gene Expression Analysis  
  - *Figure 1A:* Clustered heatmap of normalized gene expression between HBR and UHR samples  
  - *Figure 1B:* Volcano plot highlighting upregulated and downregulated genes  

- **Part B:** Breast Cancer Data Exploration  
  - *Figures 1C–1F:* Visualization of diagnostic features, correlations, and tumor characteristics from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset

## 🧰 Datasets
All datasets are open-source and were provided by HackBio:

1. [`hbr_uhr_top_deg_normalized_counts.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/hbr_uhr_top_deg_normalized_counts.csv)  
2. [`hbr_uhr_deg_chr22_with_significance.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/hbr_uhr_deg_chr22_with_significance.csv)  
3. [`data-3.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackBio-Internship/2025_project_collection/refs/heads/main/Python/Dataset/data-3.csv)
